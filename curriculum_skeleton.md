**For the week:**
- Study Guide - This is a review of the material we went over that day. If a student misses a class, they are expected to do the work in the Study Guide for the class they missed

- Resources - This section contains a best-of list of external resources for students on a particular topic.

- Stay Fresh - This section provides extra work for students to work on during they week should they want to keep their skills "fresh"

- Keeping' It Real - This section is a cultural section that includes an interesting article or video for a student to watch/read.

- Code Challenge - Students should be encouraged and incentivized to work on the code challenges during the week between classes. A week between meeting is hard, and students can lose a lot during that time.
