Because you're about to take an HTML trip around the world! Pick any place that you would like to visit (a country or city) and create a website that describes **three attractions** from that destination. You should include the following information for each:

1. A short description of why you want to see that attraction
2. A photo of the attraction
3. A link to another website for more information about the attraction

Split into teams of two and create a video breakout room.  You have 30 minutes!
